# Easy Contacts

A **service-oriented architecture (SOA)** is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network.

This application is intended to demonstrate SOA, here we have 2 components,
1. API server providing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on contacts
2. Web server consuming APIs from API server and rendering views

These two components communicate with each other over HTTP and the data exchange format here is JSON.
